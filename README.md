# Hiragana-Help

  - V2
  
      +  Fixed a massive error, missed because unused. Now fixed.
      +  Added Hiragana with dakuten. Enable/Disable the same way.
      
      
      > I tried to make a function to check what is 'enabled'. The attempt failed, I may return in the future to do it in a different way

  - V3
  
      + Show what is enabled / disabled. 
      >This is pretty primitive, if you want this to properly work make sure just to comment (#) on the start of the line when disabling          something.
